    "# Game description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this game the player, the prince or princess of Westeros needs to travel from Winterfell to Kingslanding in order to make a claim for the Iron Throne. \n",
    "\n",
    "The player does this by playing a dice game. Everytime the dice is thrown, the player travels closer to Kingslanding. However, randomly dragons and bandits may appear, which may or may not increase travel time. Based on the strategy and decisions of the player. There is a dominant strategy, but the player needs to figure this out by themselves and is deliberately not posted in instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When arriving in Kingslanding, the player needs to battle the King in a head to head duel! There are several key words to be typed in, and potentially there is a cheat, to guarantee a win! There is obviously a dominant strategy here as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, the player wins the duel, they go to coronation day - which is merely a formality in which the new King or Queen will be crowned!\n",
