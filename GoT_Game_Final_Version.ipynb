    "- Try/Except clause : although you have explained in class, I'm struggling to understand how this clause benefits my overall code. I have implemented it in some places, but, in this scenario, does not seem to do anything else than the else clause. Anyhow, I know 100% sure that I have done something wrong there but I am curious to see how the try/except clause would be implemented during the dice game as well as the battle with the King.\n",

    "- \"0 days to Kingslanding\", the dice game keeps going if that's given, while it should already display the message 'WELCOME TO THE RED KEEP'. Due to a bit of complexity with objects, variables that I have played around with. I'm not sure how to write the code properly. \n",

    "# Game description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this game the player, the prince or princess of Westeros needs to travel from Winterfell to Kingslanding in order to make a claim for the Iron Throne. \n",
    "\n",
    "The player does this by playing a dice game. Everytime the dice is thrown, the player travels closer to Kingslanding. However, randomly dragons and bandits may appear, which may or may not increase travel time. Based on the strategy and decisions of the player. There is a dominant strategy, but the player needs to figure this out by themselves and is deliberately not posted in instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When arriving in Kingslanding, the player needs to battle the King in a head to head duel! There are several key words to be typed in, and potentially there is a cheat, to guarantee a win! There is obviously a dominant strategy here as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, the player wins the duel, they go to coronation day - which is merely a formality in which the new King or Queen will be crowned!\n",
